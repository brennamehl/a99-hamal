## [Demo](https://youtu.be/YQng9VQ6R1o)

## Setup
1. Clone this respository
2. Run `npm install` in the terminal to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run server` to start the server
4. Use command `npm run client` *in a different terminal* to run client code
5. Go to [https://localhost:3000/](https://localhost:3000/) in a browser to open the site

**NOTE:** on Mac, these commands do not work and you should run `npm install` and run `npm start` directly in the server and client directories**
