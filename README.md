Looking to travel out of the country? AdventureAid is here to help! AdventureAid uses user information about vaccinations and languages spoken to match users with safe travel locations. 

## Setup

2. Run `npm install` in the terminal to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run server` to start the server
4. Use command `npm run client` *in a different terminal* to run client code
